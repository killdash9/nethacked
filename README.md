NetHacked
=============================================================================

NetHacked is a community-driven bugfix release of [NetHack 3.4.3](www.nethack.org).  Goals of the project include:

- To fix all bugs listed on the official [known bugs](http://www.nethack.org/v343/bugs.html) page
- To become the *de facto* "NetHack 3.4.4", recognized by the community as the gold standard bugfixed successor to NetHack 3.4.3

NetHacked is **not** a fork or mod that introduces new features or changes existing game behavior.
