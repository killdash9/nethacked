NetHacked
=============================================================================

NetHacked is a community-driven project representing the best available version of vanilla [NetHack 3.4.3](http://www.nethack.org).  Project goals include:

- To incorporate all currently-available bug fixes & to fix as many additional
  bugs as possible.
- To apply widely-accepted interface enhancements in use by the community.
- **To become the *de facto* "NetHack 3.4.4", recognized by the community as the gold standard source repository for vanilla NetHack 3.4.3.**

NetHacked is **not** a fork or mod that introduces new features or changes existing game behavior.  The only non-bugfix patches you will find here are widely-accepted interface patches, such as those used at [NAO](http://alt.org/nethack).

Check our [wiki](https://github.com/nethacked/nethacked/wiki) to see which [bugs](https://github.com/nethacked/nethacked/wiki/Bugs-fixed) are already fixed, or to see the list of applied [interface patches](https://github.com/nethacked/nethacked/wiki/Interface-patches).

Getting involved
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can help by submitting atomic patches that fix one bug at a time.  Preferably this will be done via [GitHub Pull Requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/).

To submit a bugfix or other patch as a pull request (requires GitHub account):

1. Fork this git repository.
2. Create an informatively-named topic branch indicating what bug is being addressed in that branch, e.g. "C343-241_fix".
3. Commit & push the changes fixing the indicated bug to the topic branch.
4. Send a [Pull Request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/), letting us know you've fixed Bug X.
5. That's it!

While pull requests are the preferred method for tracking patch submissions, there are other ways you can contribute patches.  You could create an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/nethacked/nethacked/issues) that specifies a particular enhancement or bug & directs us to the downloadable patch required to fix it, for example.

Other ways to help:

1. Flesh out the wiki.
2. Submit binaries (particularly for Windows).
3. Give feedback & suggestions!  They are always appreciated.

If you'd like to help the project in some other way, please let us know.  Contact us via GitHub, or via email to *nethacked dot project at gmail*.
