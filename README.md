NetHacked
=============================================================================

NetHacked is a community-driven bugfix release of [NetHack 3.4.3](www.nethack.org).  Project goals include:

- To fix all bugs listed on the official [known bugs](http://www.nethack.org/v343/bugs.html) page.
- To become the *de facto* "NetHack 3.4.4", recognized by the community as the gold standard bugfixed successor to NetHack 3.4.3.

NetHacked is **not** a fork or mod that introduces new features or changes existing game behavior.  The only non-bugfix patches you will find here are the widely-accepted interface patches used by [NAO](http://alt.org/nethack/).

How to get involved
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mainly, we need people to help by submitting atomic patches that fix one bug at a time.  Preferably this will be done via [GitHub Pull Requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/).

To submit a bugfix as a pull request (requires GitHub account):

1. Fork this git repository.
2. Create an informatively-named topic branch indicating what bug is being addressed in that branch, e.g. "C343-241_fix".
3. Commit and push the changes fixing the indicated bug to the topic branch.
4. Send a [Pull Request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/), letting us know you've fixed Bug X.
5. That's it!

While pull requests are the preferred method for tracking your patch submissions, there are certainly other ways you can contribute patches.  You could create an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/nethacked/nethacked/issues) that specifies a particular bug and directs us to the downloadable patch required to fix it, for example.

If you'd like to help the project in any other way, please let us know.  Contact us via GitHub, or via email to *nethacked dot project at gmail*.
